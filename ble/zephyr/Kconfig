	bool "Apply a patch to the Alif BLE host stack"
	default n
	help
	  Apply a patch to the BLE host stack in ROM. This enables ROM functions to be overridden
	  using a patched version.

config ALIF_BLE_HOST_PATCH_FILE
	string
	depends on ALIF_BLE_HOST_PATCHING
	  default "${ZEPHYR_ALIF_MODULE_DIR}/ble/rom_ble_stack.patch.elf"

config ALIF_BLE_HOST_THREAD_PRIORITY
	int "Priority for thread running the BLE host stack"
	default MAIN_THREAD_PRIORITY
	help
	  Set the thread priority for the BLE host stack thread.
	  The ROM host stack is not thread-safe, so calls to ROM
	  APIs should be performed from a thread with the same
	  priority as the host stack thread. This defaults to the
	  same priority as the main thread so that host stack APIs
	  can be called from main().

config ALIF_BLE_HOST_THREAD_STACKSIZE
	int "Stack size for thread running the BLE host stack"
	default 4096

config ALIF_BLE_HOST_ADDL_PRF_HEAPSIZE
	int "Additional heap size required for supported profiles"
	default 0
	help
	  Depending on the profiles enabled in the stack the profile
	  heap size allocated needs to be adjusted.
